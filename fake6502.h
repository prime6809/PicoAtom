 * You may optionally pass Fake6502 the pointer to a *
 * function which you want to be called after every  *
 * emulated instruction. This function should be a   *
 * void with no parameters expected to be passed to  *
 * it.                                               *
 *                                                   *
 * This can be very useful. For example, in a NES    *
 * emulator, you check the number of clock ticks     *
 * that have passed so you can know when to handle   *
 * APU events.                                       *
 *                                                   *
 * To pass Fake6502 this pointer, use the            *
 * hookexternal(void *funcptr) function provided.    *
 *                                                   *
 * To disable the hook later, pass NULL to it.       */
